# My Property Management Web App
Welcome to my  web  for finding rental and purchase properties! The app allows users to browse a wide selection of properties, add them to their favorites, and book appointments to visit them. As a user, you can register for an account to save your favorite properties and view your booked appointments. It also offers a password reset feature if you forget your login credentials.

My simple and intuitive user interface makes it easy to find the perfect property for your needs. Each listing is accompanied by plenty of photos to help you visualize your future home. Plus, when you book an appointment, we'll send you an email with more details so you can be fully prepared for your visit.
